## üß± Models Overview

| Model       | Description                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `User`      | Custom user (email auth, Telegram fields)            |
| `Book`      | Title, author, cover, inventory count, daily fee     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Business Logic

- **Permissions:** Users can only view/update their own borrowings/data
- **Notifications:** Asynchronous notifications with Celery + Telegram
- **Scheduling:** Daily reminders on overdue borrowings
- **Signals:** Django signals trigger notifications on borrow/create/payment events
- **Validation:** Borrowing only possible if Telegram username is set in profile
